Procurement for Construction Industry

This case study deals with the difficulties faced with the procurement procedures within the construction industry due to its inherently distributed environment. It is specifically targeted at small and medium sized site works. In this case study, your teams are bidding to SLIIT Software Development unit, for the contract to develop software to provide mobile procurement systems in the construction industry.

• The first stage of bidding is to develop a design for your software that offers both functionality to address the complexity of on-site material procurement, and offers high levels of usability for both site managers and back office staff handling orders.

• In the second round of the contract competition a team of software developers will use your designs to develop, test and evaluate a simulator for your software platform that demonstrates both the usability features and the flexibility of the system to be configured for the needs of different procurement contexts.

In the first phase, you are required to demonstrate your understanding of the domain by creating a software functional design (using UML) and user interaction designs for the software. About the case study The primary objective of this application is to enable site managers to control their procurement of goods directly and independently, without the industry common practice of being reliant upon office based staff to make orders, which can result in "lost in translation" issues. Currently, a site manager manages the demand for the goods required on his site from suppliers by using a mobile phone to initiate the chain of events that result in the creation of a purchase order. This normally means that a third party from the procurement department of the construction company has to raise the actual purchase order for the site manager.

One of the significant disadvantages of this process is that staff in the procurement department often do not possess the technical skills to understand the items being ordered, which can lead to misunderstandings and problems with orders placed. Furthermore, a site manager authorized to raise purchase orders needs to contact the procurement department to verify details of orders that have been placed on their behalf or to raise queries. The aim of this project is to create a web or standalone application and provides the site manager with direct access to a company’s purchase order system in order to:

• Generate and place purchase orders.

• Make enquiries about previously placed orders.

• Note the delivery for ordered goods so that invoices can be paid when all the goods have been delivered.
